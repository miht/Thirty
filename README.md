# Thirty
Variant of Yatzy called Thirty.

The rules for this game are as follows;

There are 10 rounds in total within this game. Each round you may roll your 6 die up to 3 times. When you're satisfied
with the rolls, you may choose one of 10 possible combinations, much similar to yahtzee. Some combinations are worth more than others,
so make sure to use them the best you can.

At the end of the game, i.e. after 10 rounds, the points from each combination will be summed up into your final score.

Have fun!
